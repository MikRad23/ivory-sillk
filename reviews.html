	<h1>Love Letters</h1>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Mikayla was an amazing coordinator to work with from Ivory & Silk Wedding and Events. Her pricing was very competitive and it was also so convenient that they also rented out decor and other wedding items. In the planning process she helped me figure out timelines as well as let me use a planning software where I could plan the seating chart and keep all of my things in one place. On the day Mikayla and her assistant helped set up all of our decorations, coordinate where wedding party and family should be, and she also helped take down a lot of our decor. It was very sleek and easy to use. The whole day went very smoothly thank to her and her team!</p>

		<p>Ivory & Silk Wedding and Events is AMAZING! At a venue that commands strict attention and can provide some tricky logistics for a planner, They were able to go above and beyond. As a DJ it is important for me to work hand in hand with a planner or coordinator and they made my life easy. Organization, attention to detail and communication were perfect. I look forward to working with them again in the future.</P>

		<p>After having a bit of an anxiety attack, I reached out to Ivory & Silk about a month before our wedding for help- thankfully they were able to make time for us on our date. I literally do not know what I would have done without their help and reassurance.</p>
